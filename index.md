This blog collects my thoughts on topics in mathematics, statistics, and data science. I work as a Data Scientist at [PriceLabs](https://hello.pricelabs.co/dynamic-pricing/), where I develop dynamic pricing algorithms for short-term rentals. I received an MSc in Applied Mathematics from the Technical University of Munich. Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Elucidata](https://www.elucidata.io) for three years, applying machine learning and statistical methods to large-scale biological datasets.
