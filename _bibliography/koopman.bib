  abstract   = {{A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincar{\'e}'s geometric picture that focuses on ``dynamics of states.'' While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of ``big data'' measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the ``dynamics of observables'' picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.}},

  abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems.
              However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken.
              We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator.
              This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series.
              We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively.
              We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples.
              Such computations are not considered in the existing literature but can be understood using our more general framework.
              In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory.
              It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science.
              We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.}

@article{williams_edmd,
  abstract      = {The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a ``black box''integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the ``stochastic Koopman operator''(Mezic in Nonlinear Dynamics 41(1--3): 309--325, 2005). Finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data and two that show potential applications of the Koopman eigenfunctions.},
